		\vspace{0.5cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Step 1:} Assumptions
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	The data consists of categorical variables (social class and type of police interaction)
	\item
	The data is from a random sample. 
	\item 
	Observations are independent (one observation does not influence another).
\end{itemize}

\noindent The two variables are independent if the conditional distributions across categories are identical.
\vspace{0.5cm}

\noindent\textbf{Step 2:} Setting Up Hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	\textbf{Null Hypothesis:} The relationship between social class and the type of police interaction is statistically independent.
	\item
	\textbf{Alternative Hypothesis:} The relationship between social class and the type of police interaction is statistically dependent.
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
	 $\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	The p-value (0.1502306) is greater than the significance level of 0.1. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that social class and the type of police interaction are statistically independent.
	\item
	In other words, we cannot conclude that there is a statistically significant relationship between social class and police interactions based on this data.

	\end{table}
	
\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?  	
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	The expected frequency represents the values that would be expected in each cell of a contingency table if the two categorical variables were independent. 
	\item
	Standardised residuals measure how much the observed frequencies deviate from the expected frequencies, helping to identify which cells contribute most to the Chi-squared statistic.
	\item 
	The larger the standardised residual, the greater the deviation from the expected value, and the more it contributes to the Chi-squared statistic.
	\item 
	Standardised residuals are distributed like z-scores, essentially indicating how many standard deviations the observed value is from the expected value. Residuals closer to 0 indicate smaller deviations from expectation, while larger residuals signal greater deviations.
	\item 
	In this analysis, a significance threshold of 0.1 is being used, which corresponds to a z-score of approximately 1.645 (as per the Z-Table). 
	\item 
	Any standardised residual with an absolute value greater than 1.645 is considered statistically significant at the 0.1 level, meaning the deviation from expected frequencies is unlikely to occur because of chance.
	\item 
	For the "Not Stopped" category, the residuals are 0.322 (Upper class) and -0.322 (Lower class), both of which are close to 0. These small residuals indicate that the observed frequencies are very similar to the expected frequencies, contributing little to the Chi-squared statistic.
	\item 
	For the "Bribe Requested" category, the residuals are -1.642 (Upper class) and 1.642 (Lower class), which are close to the critical threshold of 1.645 but do not exceed it. This suggests moderate deviations from the expected values but not enough to be considered statistically significant at the 0.1 level.
	\item 
	In the "Stopped or Given Warning" category, the residuals are 1.523 (Upper class) and -1.523 (Lower class), which also show moderate deviations from expected values but fall short of the critical threshold of 1.645.
	\item 
	Overall, since none of the standardised residuals exceed the critical value of 1.645, there is no strong statistical evidence of major deviations from the expected frequencies, meaning that the variables likely exhibit independence. This supports the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

\section*{Question 2: Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. 
\end{enumerate}
\noindent\textbf{Step 1:} Assumptions about the Data
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	Linear relationship: There is a linear relationship between the explanatory  and response variables.
	\item
	Independence: The observations are independent of each other.
	\item 
	Random Sampling: The data is randomly sampled from the population, ensuring it is representative of the population. 
	\item 
	Normally Distributed Errors: For any given value of the explanatory variable, the errors (residuals) are assumed to follow a normal distribution.
	\item 
	Constant variance (Homoscedasticity): The variance of the errors is constant across all values of the explanatory variable.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textbf{Step 2:} Setting Up Hypothesis
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	\textbf{Null Hypothesis:} The policy of reserving village council head positions for women does not affect the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities in the village. ($\beta = 0$)
	\item
	\textbf{Alternative Hypothesis:} The policy of reserving village council head positions for women does affect the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities in the village. ($\beta \neq 0$)

\noindent\textbf{Step 5:} Conclusion 
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	In a bivariate regression analysis, the slope represents both the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables (an explanatory and response variable). Specifically, in this analysis, the slope illustrates how the policy of reserving village council head positions for women impacts the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities in the village.
	\item
	If the slope is statistically significantly different from 0, it indicates a relationship between the two variables. In this case, the p-value is 0.0197, which is statistically significant at the 95 percent confidence level ($\alpha < 0.05$).
	\item 
	Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the policy of reserving village council head positions for women has no effect on the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities.
	\item 
	There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the reservation policy has an impact on the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities in the village.
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	The coefficient for the reservation policy is 9.252, which represents the slope of the relationship between the reservation policy and the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities in the village. This coefficient explains how a one-unit change in the explanatory variable (reservation policy) affects the response variable (number of drinking-water facilities).
	\item
	The coefficient is positive meaning that the reservation policy is associated with an increase in the number of new or repaired drinking-water facilities.
	\item
	The reservation policy is a binary variable (coded as 0 for no reservation policy and 1 for reservation policy). This indicates that, villages that have implemented the reservation policy tend to have approximately 9.252 more new or repaired drinking-water facilities on average when compared to villages that have no reservation policy. 
\end{itemize}
