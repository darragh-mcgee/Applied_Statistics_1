# Question 1:
# Part A:
# Step 1: Assumptions
# The data consists of categorical variables (social class and type of police
# interaction)
# The data is from a random sample.
# Observations are independent (one observation does not influence another).
# The two variables are independent if the conditional distributions across
# categories are identical.
# Step 2: Setting Up Hypothesis
# Null Hypothesis: The relationship between social class and the type of police
# interaction is statistically independent.
# Alternative Hypothesis: The relationship between social class and the type of
# police interaction is statistically dependent.
# Part B:
# Step 3: Calculate the Test-Statistic
# Chi-Squared is equal to the sum of the squared difference between the
# observed frequency and expected frequency, divided by the expected frequency
# for each cell in the contingency table.
# Observed Frequency Table: This matrix holds the observed counts as provided.

# Step 5: Conclusions
# The p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.01. Therefore,
# there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis that social
# class and the type of police interaction are statistically independent.
# This means we fail to conclude that social class and police interactions
# are dependent.
